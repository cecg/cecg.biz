<p><strong>Because <em>we</em> choose.</strong></p>

<p>Every day we don't start using a freed and alternative currency like
Bitcoin, we continue supporting an obsolete, incapable and unfair financial
system for yet another day. We have the choice between progress and
stagnation: every one of us, each and every day.</p>

<p><strong>Because <em>we</em> create.</strong></p>

<p>We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: to take part in the creation
and development of a new and disruptive technology which has the potential
to fundamentally improve our economic relations and personal freedoms.
Together, we can usher in an entirely new, more equitable and fair-minded
economic and financial system. And we're at it already.</p>

<p><strong>Because <em>we</em> want.</strong></p>

<p>Because we want to be able to communicate freely, anonymously and without
being spied upon. Because we want to be able to negotiate, make contracts
and carry out transactions privately. And because we believe that society as
a whole should be able to choose to do so too.</p>

<p><strong>And...</strong></p>

<p>Because we have nothing to lose but our barbed-wire fences.</p>
