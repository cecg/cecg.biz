TPL_FIELD_RESPONSIVEIE_LABEL="Enable Responsive For IE8?"
TPL_FIELD_RESPONSIVEIE_DESC="This option is here because IE7 and IE8 do not inherently support css media queries and requires javascript to achieve responsive effects. This will enable a script that gives IE7 and IE8 this ability. Keep in mind that responsive layouts are primarily meant for mobile devices and tablets where IE7 and IE8 do not exist, and that is why there is an option to turn this feature off if you do not wish for your site to load extra javascript. Extra javascript can impact the performance of your website. We recommend turning this feature off."

If you are using the max-body width the calculations will be based off of this setting instead of screen width. This feature will only enable if the body width is set to fluid."

TPL_FIELD_RESPONSIVETABLETCOLUMNS_DESC="Sometimes it is very hard to fit your content into the width of smaller screens such as a 7 inch tablet, especially if you are using a wide left or right column or both on the same page. With this option you can choose what to do with the center columns (content area, left, left_inset, right, and right_inset) when the screen size reaches 750px. Please note that when the screen size reaches 970px inset columns will always be combined into one column with their adjacent columns to increase content space by default. The rest of the layout will also always become one single column when the screen size reaches 580px for mobile. This feature only effects the center columns between 750px and 580px."

If you wish to control the middle_top and middle_bottom positions independently then use the settings right below this parameter. The purpose of this feature is to consolidate multiple columns of modules or articles into a single column when the available space becomes too narrow.

TPL_FIELD_RESPONROWWIDTHS_DESC="Each row in a Vertex template contains six module positions. If you are using a lot of modules in a particular row the content can become squished when the screen becomes too narrow, specifically on smaller seven inch tablet screens. The features below allow you to change the layout into multiple rows with new module widths to give each position more room at specific screen sizes. Be sure to choose the option that makes sense for the amount of modules you have in each particular row. Single Column will set all modules in that row to 100% and one module per row. Two Columns will set all modules in that row to 50% and two modules per row. Three Columns will set all modules in that row to 33.33% and three modules per row. Redis. 33/50 will set positions 1 through 3 to 33.33% and positions 4 through 6 to 50%, this setting is meant to be used when positions 1 through 5 are in use. Redis. 50/100 will set positions 1 through 2 to 50% and positions 3 through 6 to 100%. This setting will override any custom row widths you set under the Row Sizes tab when the screen size reaches the selected width. All modules will always change to a single column at 580px for mobile view. This feature is NOT available for IE7 or IE8!"
